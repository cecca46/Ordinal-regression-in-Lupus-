# Identification of genes associated to severity of kidney damage in Systemic Lupus Erythematous

The search for disease-associated genes and biomarkers relies on the discovery of statistical links between gene expression and disease phenotype. In most methods, clinical metrics are treated as binary data (e.g., disease vs. control). However, in many cases, even the most basic clinical data provide a richer description of the disease process. Rating scales such as the Tumor, Node, Metastasis staging of tumors and, more in general, measurements of disease progression, provide a measure of the degree of severity that is typically excluded from analyses. Systematic integration of these ordinal clinical metrics with gene expression data may lead to identifying a subset of the genes that play a critical role in disease progression. Once experimentally validated, these genes could be important candidates for therapeutic targets.
To develop an approach that can take advantage of information on the severity of the disease, we analyzed gene expression data from glomeruli tissues in Systemic Lupus Erythematous (SLE) and Living Donors (LD). Patients who suffer of SLE can be classified in five categories that, identified using the estimated filtration rate (eGFR) numbers, depict the severity and pattern of decline of the kidney filtering function.
